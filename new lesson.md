## Say hi too all over the world
I`m just trying to learn language
help me please
Shall i write *"git init"* if i create a new folder or just write _"git add" "name of folder"_.

Because i have created new folder and then create new file in this folder. But i can`t add this file to track by the git? cause of error:
Git said "fatal: pathspec 'new lesson.md' did not match any files".
